2) Install http://msysgit.github.io/ for git on windows.

3) Install IIS: http://www.howtogeek.com/112455/how-to-install-iis-8-on-windows-8/ . Be sure to select ASP.NET and friends or the tests will fail with an unhelpful error message.

advanced debugging
==================

The acceptance tests spin up containerizer in IIS out of process and communicate with it over HTTP. Unfortunately, this means it's more difficult to debug the server. To debug:

1) Have the server running (i.e. stop execution after starting an acceptance test, but before letting it be killed at the end of the test). To be sure that the server is correctly running, you should allow at least one request to hit the server, or IIS might not spin it up right away.

2) Open a new instance of Visual Studio as Administrator and open the Containerizer solution. Then, go in the debug menu and select "Attach to Process"

3) Attach to the w3wp.exe process in the available processes. Make sure that you click "Show processes from all users".

4) You can now hit debug points in the server!
